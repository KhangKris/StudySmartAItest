# StudySmartAI - Intelligent Study Management App

StudySmartAI is a React Native mobile application designed to help students manage their learning tasks intelligently. It uses an AI-driven approach to schedule tasks and a discipline system to help users stay focused.

This project was built with **Expo**, **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, and **Expo SQLite**.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete study tasks.
- **AI-Powered Scheduling**: Automatically prioritizes and schedules tasks based on due date and priority.
- **Focus Mode**: A simulated app-locking mechanism that penalizes users for leaving the app when they have pending tasks.
- **Discipline System**: A point-based system that rewards focus and penalizes distractions.

## Project Structure

The project is structured in a modular way to keep the code clean and maintainable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device, or an emulator.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd StudySmartAI
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Metro bundler.

4.  **Open the app:**
    -   Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone.
    -   Or, press `a` for Android emulator or `i` for iOS simulator.

## Core Modules Explained

### 1. Task Management

-   **`databaseService.ts`**: Handles all communication with the local SQLite database.
-   **`taskStore.ts`**: Manages the state of tasks in the application using Zustand. It fetches tasks from the database and provides actions (add, update, delete) to the UI.
-   **`HomeScreen` (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)**: Displays the list of tasks and allows users to add new ones through a modal.

### 2. AI Scheduling

-   **`aiService.ts`**: Contains the heuristic-based algorithm for sorting tasks. It assigns a score to each task based on its priority and due date, then suggests an optimal order and start time.
-   **`AIPlanScreen` (`app/(tabs)/ai-plan.tsx`)**: Visualizes the schedule generated by the `aiService`.

### 3. Focus Mode & Discipline System

-   **`focusModeService.ts`**: This service **simulates** app usage monitoring. It uses React Native's `AppState` to detect when the user leaves the app. If "Focus Mode" is active, it starts a timer and, after a delay, applies a penalty to the user's discipline score.
-   **`userStore.ts`**: Manages the `disciplineScore` and persists it using `AsyncStorage`.
-   **`FocusModeScreen` (`app/(tabs)/focus-mode.tsx`)**: Allows the user to activate/deactivate Focus Mode and view their current discipline score.

**Note on Focus Mode Simulation:** A true app-blocking feature requires deep native integration with Android's `UsageStatsManager` or iOS's Screen Time API, which is beyond the scope of a standard Expo managed project. The current implementation provides a functional demonstration of the penalty system.
